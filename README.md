# learn-programming

This project is a repository that holds methods of learning programming so that
my friends can easily pick up the hobby/profession.

## Getting Started

Before you begin programming, there are a couple of steps and processes that are
required and recommended. These include reading documents about industry
standard applications, websites, and processes as well as getting your
environment setup. These will vary based on the line of work or project, but I
will try to keep the material broad and provide resources for additional reading
and guidance.

### Recommended Readings

1. [GitHub Briefing](readings/github.md)

### Environment Setup

#### Mac
