# learn-programming

This project is a repository that holds methods of learning programming so that
my friends can easily pick up the hobby/profession.

## Getting Started

Before you begin programming, there are a couple of steps and processes that are
required and recommended. These include reading documents about industry
standard applications, websites, and processes as well as getting your
environment setup. These will vary based on the line of work or project, but I
will try to keep the material broad and provide resources for additional reading
and guidance.

### As you Work, Both in This Repository and Elsewhere

While going through this repository and as you begin to learn how to program and
approach problems with a critical and logical lense, be mindful of things that
you find are challenging or unclear. It is more than likely that someone else
will too! This is a great time to become familiar with collaboration within a
programming environment! If you run into anything that gives you trouble you
should open an [issue](https://github.com/ajchili/learn-programming/issues/new).
By opening an issue, a solution can be reached with input from anyone involved
and others who may face a similar issue can reference it to gain an
understanding for potential solutions.
