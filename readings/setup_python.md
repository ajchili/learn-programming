1. Ensure Homebrew is installed, refer to [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) for
   instillation steps
2. Open up the Terminal app
3. Within the terminal type `brew install python`, this may take some time as
   Homebrew updates itself and downloads Python

   **3.y.z**, where at least the major version is **3**
